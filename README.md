Abstract:
Okun’s law is an empirical observation indicating that if unemployment decreases, a
country’s production, or GDP (Gross Domestic Product), will rise. According to Okun’s theory,
a 1% decline in the unemployment rate will result in a 2% rise in GDP. Utilizing our collected
data from 58 California counties, we shall attempt to determine Okun’s coefficient for the years
2010 to 2019. The findings of our study concluded that Okun’s law does not hold when data is
collected at the county level and thus different parameters should be used to examine its validity.
